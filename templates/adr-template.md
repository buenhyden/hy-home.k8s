# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

> Use this template for `docs/<category>/adr/NNNN-short-title.md`.
>
> Repository-derived contract:
>
> - Use exactly one meaningful H1.
> - Use relative links only.
> - Remove every placeholder before saving.
> - Keep the document decision-focused. Do not turn ADRs into implementation specs.
> - Allowed ADR status values: `Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated`.
> - Allowed scope values where your doc set uses them: `master | domain | historical`.
> - Keep all structural and narrative content in English.
> - Add exactly one `Overview (KR)` summary near the top. That overview summary alone should be written in Korean.
>
> Shape guidance:
>
> - Use the extended shape for `content/` and `vault/` domain decisions or any decision that needs alternatives, trade-offs, and traceability detail.
> - Use the compact shape for lightweight governance or documentation-boundary ADRs such as the `docs/web` V2 active chain.

## Optional Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: 'ADR NNNN: [Short Decision Title]'
status: 'Accepted'
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
authors: ['buenhyden']
deciders: ['buenhyden']
tags: ['adr', '<category>', '<topic>']

```

Use frontmatter when the surrounding doc set already uses it. Skip it when the active document family is intentionally compact.

## H1 and Metadata

# ADR NNNN: [Short Decision Title]

- **Status:** [Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated]
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Scope:** [master | domain | historical]
- **Authors:** [Optional]

**Overview (KR):** [Write a 1-2 sentence Korean summary of the decision intent, why it matters now, and what boundary it affects.]

## Required Core Sections

### Compact Form

## Decision

- [Decision point 1]
- [Decision point 2]
- [Decision point 3]

## Consequences

- **Observability**: [How this decision improves traceability, incident handling, or evidence]
- **Compliance**: [How this decision aligns with repo rules, policy, or standards]
- **Performance**: [Performance impact or reason there is no impact]
- **Documentation**: [How this decision improves document structure and authority]
- **Localization**: [Language, bilingual, or locale implications]

### 3.2 Positive Consequences

- [Positive consequence 1]
- [Positive consequence 2]
- [Positive consequence 3]

### 3.3 Negative Consequences

- **Bad**, because [trade-off]

## 5. Confidence Level & Technical Requirements

- **Confidence Rating:** [Low | Medium | High]
- **Notes:** [Why this confidence level is justified and what would improve it]
- **Technical Requirements Addressed:** [For example: REQ-PRD-FUN-01, REQ-SPC-001]
