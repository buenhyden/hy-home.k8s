# Standardized Templates (`templates/`)

This directory contains the immutable foundations for all documentation and specifications generated in this project.

## 1. Necessity and Purpose

This directory exists to enforce structural consistency across all text-based artifacts generated by either Humans or AI Agents. It is necessary to ensure that documents are machine-readable, parsing-friendly, and maintain a high standard of completeness.
Without this folder, Spec-Driven Development would fail due to inconsistent formatting.

## 2. Golden Rule for AI Agents

**NO HALLUCINATED FORMATTING.**
When generating an ADR, ARD, PRD, Runbook, or Spec, you **MUST** read the exact markdown structure of the template in this folder and output your document adhering entirely to its headers and structure. You must never invent your own format.

## 3. Required Content & Destinations

The templates are pre-written here to serve specific output locations. Each template dictates exactly what content must be filled in.

| Template File                                | Destination Directory | Created By          | Required Content / Purpose               |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `architecture/adr-template.md`               | `docs/adr/`           | Planner Agent       | Context, Options, and Decision (Why)     |
| `architecture/ard-template.md`               | `docs/ard/`           | Planner Agent       | System Context, Container Diagrams (How) |
| `product/prd-template.md`                    | `docs/prd/`           | Planner Agent       | Success Metrics, Epics, User Stories     |
| `engineering/spec-template.md`               | `specs/`              | Planner Agent       | Step-by-step code implementation rules   |
| `engineering/api-spec-template.md`           | `specs/<feature>/api/`| Planner Agent       | OpenAPI endpoints, params, response schemas|
| `operations/runbook-template.md`             | `runbooks/`           | DevOps / Coder      | Bash commands, rollbacks, and triggers   |
| `operations/postmortem-template.md`          | `docs/manuals/`       | DevOps / Human      | RCA, Five Whys, Timeline (SEV-1/2)       |
| `guides/collaboration-guide-template.md`     | `docs/manuals/`       | Human / Planner     | SLAs, DoD, Branching Agreements          |
| `guides/operations-guide-template.md`        | `docs/manuals/`       | DevOps              | Generic readiness and observability rules|
| `guides/qa-security-guide-template.md`       | `docs/manuals/`       | QA / Sec Agent      | Security thresholds and test standards   |
| `project/readme-template.md`                 | `/`                   | Planner Agent       | Root project value prop and badges       |
| `project/plan-template.md`                   | `/`                   | Planner Agent       | High-level task milestones and stages    |

## 4. Anti-Patterns & Boundaries

- **Never place operational templates in `docs/`**: The `runbook-template.md` is strictly used to create executable documents inside `/runbooks/`.
- **Never modify templates during execution**: AI Agents must NOT alter the template structures here unless explicitly commanded to evolve the global standard by a Human.
- If the project requires a new standardized document type (e.g., specific security audit report), the structure MUST be defined here as `[name]-template.md` before agents are instructed to produce it.
