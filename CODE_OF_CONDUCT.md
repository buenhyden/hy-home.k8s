# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Necessity & Required Content

This `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file is necessary to outline the ethical and behavioral expectations for both human contributors and AI entities operating within the repository.
**What Must Be Written Here**:

- Human-to-human behavioral standards.
- Human-to-AI prompt ethics and anti-harassment rules.
- Reporting instructions for safety violations.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate.

## Reporting

Report incidents to the maintainers through a private channel:

- Email: `conduct@example.com`
- Or repository maintainers listed in `.github/CODEOWNERS`

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, code review discussions, and other official communication channels.

## Responsible AI Collaboration

As this repository utilizes AI agents for development and review, all interactions with AI (prompts, issues, PR comments) must also adhere to our community standards. Furthermore, contributors must align with `.agent/rules/0106-responsible-ai.md` to ensure that AI is utilized in an ethically sound, unbiased, and safe manner.
