# Manuals

This folder stores process-oriented manuals for contributors and operators.

## Typical Documents

- Collaboration playbooks (e.g., `collaboration-guide.md`)
- Onboarding guides
- Project operating procedures

Keep manuals concise, role-specific, and linked from root policy files.

## Project Governance & Rule Overrides

While generic organizational standards reside in `.agent/rules/`, the manuals in this folder establish the living working agreements for this specific team/project. For example, SLAs and DoDs defined in `collaboration-guide.md` actively override generic agent behaviors. AI Agents must prioritize these local governance manuals during execution.
