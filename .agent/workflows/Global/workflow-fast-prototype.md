# Fast Prototype Workflow

1. Acknowledge that the project is in Prototype/Fast-Track Mode.
2. Skip the creation of long Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) or Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).
3. Create a single, concise specification file at `specs/fast-prototype.md` to capture the immediate requirements.
4. Proceed immediately to the implementation phase (writing code and tests).
5. Ensure that the resulting code runs successfully before completing the task.
