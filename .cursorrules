# Project Rules

This project is a GitOps-based Kubernetes infrastructure platform.

## Preferred Tech Stack
- Kubernetes (Kind for local development)
- GitOps: ArgoCD, Helm
- Service Mesh: Istio
- Observability: Prometheus Stack, Loki, Tempo, Alloy, Grafana
- Database: PostgreSQL (Patroni), Redis Cluster
- Security: Kyverno, Cert-Manager, Sealed Secrets
- Languages: YAML, Python, Markdown

## Architecture Principles
1. **Everything as Code**: All infrastructure and applications must be defined in manifest files or Helm charts.
2. **GitOps Workflow**: Changes are applied via Git commits to the `main` branch, synchronized by ArgoCD.
3. **Local First**: Ensure the platform can be initialized locally using Kind scripts in `bootstrap/`.
4. **Modularity**: Infrastructure components are organized in `infrastructure/`, and applications in `apps/`.
5. **Security by Default**: Use Sealed Secrets for sensitive data and Kyverno for policy enforcement.

## Coding Standards
- **YAML**: Follow standard indentation (2 spaces). Use clear and descriptive names for resources.
- **Python**: Use type hints. Follow PEP 8.
- **Documentation**: README files should be present in every major directory, following the project template.

## Agent Specifics
- Use the provided issue and pull request templates for tracking changes.
- Disclose AI tool usage in pull requests.
